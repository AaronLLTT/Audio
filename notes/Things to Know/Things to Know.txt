Here is important info to know about Audio Effects.

1) Audio effects are played on audio busses. You can play them directly on the main bus (audio_bus_main), and
every single sound played in your game will be effected by them that way. Or you can create your own audio bus
and assign audio effects to those busses, and play sounds through them, to only effect certain sounds.

2) Audio busses can up to 8 audio effects active at once. You assign them to an array that can be found at 
audio_bus_main[0 - 7] (or your_custom_audio_bus[0 - 7]). They must be assigned like this:

	var delayEffect = audio_effect_create(AudioEffectType.Delay);
	delayEffect.bypass = is_bypassed;
	delayEffect.time = time;
	delayEffect.feedback = feedback;
	delayEffect.mix = mix;
	audio_bus_main.effects[n] = delayEffect;
	
3) Audio effects can stack on top of each other. If you assign a delay of 1 second to the first effect slot
in an audio bus, and assign another delay of 1 second in another slot, the total delay will be 2 seconds. In
this way, you can have as strong of an effect as you want by stacking and multiplaying them by themselves.

4) To reset an effect slot in an audio bus, you can assign it to undefined. This will reset it completely.
You cannot go into a slot and effect properties individually, even though it's a struct. You must either
set it to undefined completely, or create a new struct (with audio_effect_create) and fill in the properties
and assign it that way.

5) Each audio effect has its own unique properties. The delay audio effect has settings for bypass (which
every audio effect has), time, feedback, and mix (this property is also shared among all audio effects).
To know which properties an audio effect have, you can view the page with the struct and properties
of each audio effect here:

6) Loop points can be set to start and end whenever, but they'll only take effect if the sound being played
has loop set to true when playing it. The loop start and end are applied to sound asset, not just the
sound being played. This means that you only need to set it once when the game begins and it will remember
that every time it's played after.
